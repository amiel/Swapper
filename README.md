## Purpose

I wrote this app to experiment with unit testing in Objective-C.
Contact me if you really want an explanation.

## Customizing the patterns

Right now all of the available site-swaps are hardcoded in a static
array in `PatternChooserController.m`.

## Site Swap

> [SiteSwap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siteswap) is a notation used
> to describe juggling patterns. It encodes the number of beats of each
> throw, which is related to their height, and the hand to which the throw
> is to be made.

This app turns site swap in to a puzzle game.
